## Guide

### Set up your game

Before you start playing, you may want to set up your Jeopardy board and your teams.

#### Set Categories

Edit the input fields to set the Categories of your game

#### Create Teams

Write the Team-name in the input field, and press "Add team".

#### Remove Teams

You can easily remove teams by clicking "DELETE" on the relevant teams.

#### Save

The save button saves your settings to Locale Storage. This means that you are free to close your browser and come back at a later time.
This way, you can take your time to set up your game the day before.

#### Start

After saving your set-up, you can start the game, navigating to the play-page. Share your screen or display on a monitor and enjoy!

### Playing the game

#### Show scores

Toggles display of the scores for each team.

#### Adding scores

Drag and drop a card over to a team to assign that team the points. The card is removed when assigned to a team.

#### Undo

After assigning points to a team, a undo button will appear in the top left corner. Feel free to use this to undo your latest change.
Note that only the latest change can be undone.

## Feedback, feature requests, bugs

Please feel free to submit any feedback and feature requests you may have, and of course please create an issue if you find a bug.

### Adding notes to each Card

I'm considering adding functionality to add a note to each card. This note can be displayed when the card is clicked, or just written to console (so that the game master may see it).
This may be useful to remember what the question for the current card was.

### Reset

I'm considering adding a reset button that removes all your set-up and lets you start over. This may be useful if something has gone wrong.

Enjoy!
